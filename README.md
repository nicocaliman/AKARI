This puzzle is played on a rectangular grid of cells.
The player places light bulbs in white cells such that no 2 bulbs shine on each other, until the entire grid is lit up.
A light bulb sends light horizontally and vertically, illuminating its entire row and column unless its light crashes into a black cell.
Black cells are enumerated from 0-4, indicating how many bulbs must be placed adjacent to its 4 sides.

This logic puzzle is also known as "LIGHT UP".
